Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Focus on Properties and Their Relationship with Price
We'll explore how different features of the houses (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, pool, elevator, etc.) relate to the price. Here's the step-by-step plan:

Data Overview
Check basic statistics for the numerical features.
Identify ranges and distributions for key features.
2. Correlation Analysis
Calculate correlations between numerical features and price.
Identify the most influential features.
 Visualizations
Use plots to visualize relationships between features and price:
Bar Plots: Categorical features (e.g., pool, elevator, furnished).
Scatter Plots: Continuous features (e.g., size, number of rooms).
Box Plots: Distribution of price across categories.
4. Key Questions to Explore
How do features like bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchen affect the price?
Does having a pool, elevator, or being furnished impact the price?
What is the price trend with property size and age?
